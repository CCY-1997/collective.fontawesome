How to use
==========

To use an icon you can add 'fa fa-X' to your tag where X is the icon you want::


    <ul>
        <li class="fa fa-glass">item 1</li>
        <li class="fa fa-music">item 2</li>
        <li class="fa fa-search">item 3</li>
    </ul>

Or just use CSS for your class 'myclass'::

    .myclass:before {
        content: "\f000"; 
        font-family: FontAwesome;
        font-style: normal;
        font-weight: normal;
        text-decoration: inherit;
    }

Available CSS classes and values for the content attribute can be found in the `Font Awesome cheat sheet <http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/>`_ or in the `source code <https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/css/font-awesome.css#L171>`_ (file: font-awesome.css#L171 at the time of writing).

Replacing Plone's default icons with FontAwesome fonts
------------------------------------------------------

There is now a separate Generic Setup profile called ``replace-plone-icons`` which
will replace Plone's default icons (e.g. for content types and actions) with
Font Awesome icons.

**IMPORTANT:** You still need to install the ``default`` profile as well.

A ``replace-plone-icons`` profile example is available in the add-on, here is a screenshot:
